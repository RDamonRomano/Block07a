      Homer (/ˈhoʊmər/; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος [hómɛːros], Hómēros; born c. 8th
      century BC) was a Greek poet who is credited as the author of the Iliad
      and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are foundational works of ancient
      Greek literature. Homer is considered one of the most revered and
      influential authors in history.

      Publius Vergilius Maro (Classical Latin: [ˈpuːbliʊs wɛrˈɡɪliʊs ˈmaroː];
      traditional dates 15 October 70 BC – 21 September 19 BC), usually called
      Virgil or Vergil (/ˈvɜːrdʒɪl/ VUR-jil) in English, was an ancient Roman
      poet of the Augustan period.[1] He composed three of the most famous poems
      in Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the
      epic Aeneid. A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix
      Vergiliana, were attributed to him in ancient times, but modern scholars
      consider his authorship of these poems to be dubious.[2] Virgil's work has
      had great influence on Western literature, most notably Dante's Divine
      Comedy, in which Virgil appears as the author's guide through Hell and
      Purgatory.[3] Virgil has been traditionally ranked as one of Rome's
      greatest poets. Since its composition, his Aeneid has been considered the
      national epic of ancient Rome.[4]

        Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and is
        considered to be among the country's national poets and the Western
        world's greatest literary icons.[12] His depictions of Hell, Purgatory,
        and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art and
        literature.[13][14] He influenced English writers such as Geoffrey
        Chaucer, John Milton, and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In
        addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or
        the terza rima, is attributed to him. He is described as the "father" of
        the Italian language,[15] and in Italy he is often referred to as il
        Sommo Poeta ("the Supreme Poet"). Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are
        also called the tre corone ("three crowns") of Italian literature.
