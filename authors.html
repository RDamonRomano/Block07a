    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgil</a></h1>

    Publius Vergilius Maro (Classical Latin: [ˈpuːbliʊs wɛrˈɡɪliʊs ˈmaroː];
    traditional dates 15 October 70 BC – 21 September 19 BC), usually called
    Virgil or Vergil (/ˈvɜːrdʒɪl/ VUR-jil) in English, was an ancient Roman poet
    of the Augustan period.[1] He composed three of the most famous poems in
    Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic
    Aeneid. A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, were
    attributed to him in ancient times, but modern scholars consider his
    authorship of these poems to be dubious.[2] Virgil's work has had great
    influence on Western literature, most notably Dante's Divine Comedy, in
    which Virgil appears as the author's guide through Hell and Purgatory.[3]
    Virgil has been traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets. Since
    its composition, his Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient
    Rome.[4]

    <p>
      Dante Alighieri (Italian: [ˈdante aliˈɡjɛːri]; c. May 1265 – September 14,
      1321), most likely baptized Durante di Alighiero degli Alighieri[note 1]
      and often referred to as Dante (English: /ˈdɑːnteɪ, ˈdænteɪ,
      ˈdænti/,[3][4] US: /ˈdɑːnti/[5]), was an Italian[a] poet, writer, and
      philosopher.[7] His Divine Comedy, originally called Comedìa (modern
      Italian: Commedia) and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio,[8]
      is widely considered one of the most important poems of the Middle Ages
      and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.[9][10]

      Dante is known for establishing the use of the vernacular in literature at
      a time when most poetry was written in Latin, which was accessible only to
      educated readers. His De vulgari eloquentia (On Eloquence in the
      Vernacular) was one of the first scholarly defenses of the vernacular. His
      use of the Florentine dialect for works such as The New Life (1295) and
      Divine Comedy helped establish the modern-day standardized Italian
      language. By writing his poem in the Italian vernacular rather than in
      Latin, Dante influenced the course of literary development, making Italian
      the literary language in western Europe for several centuries.[11] His
      work set a precedent that important Italian writers such as Petrarch and
      Boccaccio would later follow.

      Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and is
      considered to be among the country's national poets and the Western
      world's greatest literary icons.[12] His depictions of Hell, Purgatory,
      and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art and
      literature.[13][14] He influenced English writers such as Geoffrey
      Chaucer, John Milton, and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In addition,
      the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the terza
      rima, is attributed to him. He is described as the "father" of the Italian
      language,[15] and in Italy he is often referred to as il Sommo Poeta ("the
      Supreme Poet"). Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called the tre
      corone ("three crowns") of Italian literature.
