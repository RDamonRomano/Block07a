      The first half of the story discusses Gilgamesh (who was king of Uruk) and
      Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing
      the people of Uruk. After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual
      initiation with Shamhat, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh
      to a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins the contest; nonetheless, the two
      become friends. Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary
      Cedar Forest, where they ultimately slay its Guardian, Humbaba, and cut
      down the sacred Cedar.[5] The goddess Ishtar sends the Bull of Heaven to
      punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the
      Bull of Heaven, insulting Ishtar in the process, after which the gods
      decide to sentence Enkidu to death and kill him by giving him a fatal
      illness.

      In the second half of the epic, distress over Enkidu's death causes
      Gilgamesh to undertake a long and perilous journey to discover the secret
      of eternal life. He eventually learns that "Life, which you look for, you
      will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his
      share, and life withheld in their own hands".
